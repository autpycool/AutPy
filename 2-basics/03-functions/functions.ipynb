While short and tempting, you should **never use it**: It even catches things like typos in your code (e.g. `NameError` for a missing variable) or the user trying to interrupt the program (`KeyboardInterrupt`).

    "- A function called `check(name)`, it returns `True` or `False` based on some conditions (see below).\n",
    "- Another function called `fix(firstname, lastname)` returns the name as a string in a required format.\n",

    "\n",
    "A name is deemed correct based on the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Does not start or end with a space (both `␣Hermione` and `Hermione␣` are not valid names, with `␣` being a space character).\n",
    "* Is longer than 1 character (`H` is not a valid name).\n",
    "* Does only contain letters (`Herm!one` and `Hermi0n3` are not valid names).\n",

    "\n",
    "* Last name first, then a comma, then first name\n",
