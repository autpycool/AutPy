                "- **[JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) (JavaScript Object Notation)**, coming from the Javascript programming language as indicated by the name, but widely used outside of Javascript as well. Very often used when talking to services on the web (APIs).\n",
                "- [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) (YAML Ain't Markup Language), often used as a configuration language. Not used in this course, but something you will undoubtely see again later in your studies.\n",
                "- [TOML](https://toml.io/) (Tom's Obvious Minimal Language), intended as a simpler alternative to JSON/YAML for configuration files. Rather new (originally introduced in 2013), but getting more and more popular, especially for configuring Python tools.\n",
                "- [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xml) (Extensible Markup Language), originally started in 1996 and the base for HTML, used for authoring websites.
