Libraries allow you to handle input/output data appropriate data types and structures, instead of the \"flat\" unstructured text data returned by executing a system command. It may take more time to get to know the library at first, and to set it up, but it will save you time in handling and parsing data in the long run.\n",

This mitigates some security issues, where unrelated commands could be injected if arguments are controlled by (malicious) user input. It also means that you do **not have to worry** about most special characters: While e.g. `'` and `\"` inside a string have a special meaning for a shell, they are not a problem when using `subprocess` with the default setting.\n",

As soon as a shell is involved between Python and the command being executed, you will have to **deal with special characters**, will potentially have **security issues** when not doing so, and you will need to **take care of platform differences** between different shells/operating systems.\n",
