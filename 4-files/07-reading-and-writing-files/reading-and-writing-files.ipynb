    "# Reading and Writing Files\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter is about reading files from the file system and writing to them. After finishing this lab, you can finally store data and reuse it!\n",
    "\n",
    "*[Chapter 7](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter7/) in the book is about [regular expressions](https://realpython.com/regex-python/), which are a \"mini-language\" to search or match strings based on a pattern like `[a-z]{1,5}` (a character between a and z, between 1 and 5 times). You will learn more about regular expressions in other modules such as [Automaten und Sprachen](https://studien.rj.ost.ch/allModules/24404_M_AutoSpr.html), so we are skipping the topic in this course.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instead, his notebook covers the [ninth chapter](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter9/) of the book.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning:** This lab will diverge from the book in a couple of important ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The book describes Windows paths in most examples, while the Jupyter environment is based on Linux. Thus, paths will look like `/usr/lib` rather than e.g. `C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32`.\n",
    "- In the *\"Opening Files with the open() Function\"* section, as well as the following sections after that: If you open a file, you will need to close it again. Otherwise, you could risk issues like **data not being fully written** to the file. Contrary to what the book shows, *don't use* `f = open(...)`. Instead, use a `with` block, which leads to Python automatically closing the file once the block is finished:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(...) as f:\n",
    "    # code that does something with 'f'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Starting with the *\"Saving Variables with the shelve Module\"* section (including that section), we recommend you **ignore the rest of the book chapter** entirely. There are some good ways to store Python data in a file which we'll look at in later labs - unfortunately, the ways shown by the book (`shelve` and `pprint`) have various flaws. **Don't use them.**\n",
    "- In addition, we go over some other good practices below. Please review them as well.\n",
    "- Because of those issues in the book, we suggest that you only use the book chapter to get a rough overview of the topic, but then focus on the summary and/or optional resources below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional resources\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find more information about reading and writing files in the Python documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Tutorial: 7. Input and Output](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#tut-files)\n",
    "- [Built-in Functions: `open`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open)\n",
    "- [`pathlib` — Object-oriented filesystem paths](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional examples by PyMOTW (Python Module of the week):\n",
    "\n",
    "- [pathlib — Filesystem Paths as Objects](https://pymotw.com/3/pathlib/index.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevant Real Python tutorials:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Reading and Writing Files in Python (Guide)](https://realpython.com/read-write-files-python/)\n",
    "- [Working With Files in Python](https://realpython.com/working-with-files-in-python/) (covers some material from the next lab)\n",
    "- [Python 3's pathlib Module: Taming the File System](https://realpython.com/python-pathlib/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Good practices\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with files, **keep a couple of \"rules\" in mind**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Treating file paths as strings is usually a bad idea. You will need to take special care that your code works on both Windows and Linux/macOS as they use different characters to separate parts of the path. Python provides the (older) `os.path` library to do so. However, always prefer **using the `pathlib` library** which lets you handle paths in a much nicer way.\n",
    "- **Be careful when deleting** files. You won't need to do so in this lab, but you will in the next lab.\n",
    "- Be careful when **changing the current working directory** (e.g. via `os.chdir`). Doing so could have unintended side-effects, so it's best avoided.\n",
    "- Use the provided **separate cells** to try out your code, only define the function in the first cell, without calling it. This is to avoid interfering with the tests running those cells."

    "### Path Management\n",

    "* Root-Folder (Anchor)\n",
    "  * Folder-1 (Parent is the Root-Folder)\n",
    "    * Folder-2 (Parent is Folder-1)\n",
    "      * Folder-3 (Parent is Folder-2)\n",
    "        * Filename.Extension\n",
    "        \n",
    "From the point of view of the file, all folders above it are the _parent_. The filename is also called _stem_ and the extension is the _suffix_.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Windows\n",
    "In Windows, _backslashes_ are used to separate paths of a path: `Drive:\\Root-Folder\\Folder-1\\Folder-2\\Folder-3\\Filename.Extension`. An example would be `C:\\Users\\harry\\school\\potions.xlsx`. The `C:` points to the drive, for example a hard disk or a USB stick. `.xlsx` is the file extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that backslashes also have a special meaning in Python strings:** They are used for escape characters such as `\\n`. Thus, to store a Windows path in a string, you will need to double the backslashes (`\"C:\\\\Users\"`) or use a raw string (`r\"C:\\Users\")`. However, most of the time you should use `pathlib` instead - see below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unix-based Systems\n",
    "On Linux and MacOS, _slashes_ are used to separate paths of a path: `/Folder-1/Folder-2/Folder-3/Filename.Extension`. The path starts with a slash because the first slash indicates the root folder. An example would be `/home/harry/school/potions.xlsx`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Paths in Python\n",
    "Thankfully, Python provides a nice abstraction over different path notations - you don't have to worry about the OS your Python app is running on. If you work with paths, use the `Path` class from the `pathlib` module:"

Additionally, data is sometimes not written to the file immediately - thus, it's very important that you **take care of closing files properly**.\n",

    "When you create, modify or read a file, you have to indicate in which mode you want to open it. The modes we're looking at in this chapter are the following:\n",

    "  * _w_ write\n",
    "  * _a_ append\n",
    "  \n",

    "\n",
    "Sometimes you want to store some data from your application in order to load it again on the next run. The book proposes two ways of doing so. Unfortunately, both ways presented in the book **have serious issues** in real-world applications, and are thus **not recommended**:\n",

    "- The [shelve](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shelve.html) module (in the section *Saving Variables with the shelve Module*)\n",
    "- Using [pprint.pformat](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pprint.html) (in the section *Saving Variables with the pprint.pformat() Function*)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `shelve` module is based on [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) - it looks like a very simple way to store/load any kind of Python objects, but don't be fooled by its simplicity - be aware of [Pickle's nine flaws](https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/202006/pickles_nine_flaws.html) before using it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pprint.pformat` function is shown as another approach at data serialization in the book, which is not what this module is intended for at all - it works for most primitive data types, but this is a bad \"hack\" with much better solutions available.\n",
    "\n",
    "With both approaches, among other issues, **loading stored data can run arbitrary Python code**, and thus they are unsuitable for content from an untrusted source. Imagine someone sends you data and you load it with `shelve` - it could contain malicious code that can harm your computer and you would not even notice when loading it!\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of all those issues with the approaches presented in the book, we do not show them here, there is also no exercise using `shelve` or `pprint.pformat`. There are several better ways to persist application data, such as [JSON](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html). We will look at it in a later lab."

    "### Exercise 4: Find Files\n",
    "To conclude this lab, you are going to write a small tool that may even help you in your daily work! People familiar with Linux might recognise this tool as an imitation of `grep`; it works as follows: The function `find_files(rootdir, extension, keyword)` takes a directory, a file extension and a keyword. It recursively searches all subfolders from the directory and checks all files of a given extension to find a specific keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that tools such as `grep` typically accept a pattern (a [\"regular expression\"](https://realpython.com/regex-python/)). Since we've skipped that topic in the book, your `find_files` is much simpler: It just checks whether the given string is contained in a line, without any support for patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the `create_files_and_folders` function and the text excerpts from the previous exercise to check if `find_files` works the way it should.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `rootdir`: A `Path` object. The path to the directory to start your search from. When `rootdir` is a non-existing directory or a file, make sure your function returns an empty list instead. Hint: You shouldn't need to check for those cases manually.\n",
    "* `extension`: A string. The file extension to search for, e.g. `txt` or `png` (*without* leading dot).\n",
    "* `keyword`: A string. The keyword that should be searched for in the files matching the file extension.\n",
    "* The function returns a list of strings with the elements found. Format: `some/subfolder/filename.txt:linenumber:line`.\n",
    "  - The path should be **relative to the given `rootdir`**\n",
    "  - Lines are counted **starting at 1**\n",
    "  - The trailing `\\n` in lines is **stripped off**\n",
    "* If binary data is read, the program should not crash, the file should just **be ignored**. You can create a file that contains binary data like so: \n",
    "`pathlib.Path(\"data\", \"program.bin\").write_bytes(b\"\\xC0\\xFF\\xEE\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected output (pretty-printed for readability, your function should return a list of strings):\n",
